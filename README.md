#NCAA tournament pricing model
This script is a monte-carlo simulation which predicts the NCAA tournament not by skill but by capturing the teams that are the most undervalued according to 538's predictions then removing pick biases by Yahoo users. Many functions are written not to be elegant (due to time constraints) but the runs are written to be speed efficient.  Paralleled to optimally run on multicore (16+?) machines.

##2016 Conclusion
1. Virginia is extremely under priced as the winner
2. Top choices for "Cinderlla" this year: Wichita St., Yale, Gonzaga, Texas
